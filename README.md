## ðŸ§­ System Design Notes

The diagram below outlines the full architecture of the warehouse simulation.
It was created early in the project, before I had the skills to implement every component.

Documenting the system this way helped me reason about interactions
between classes (Products, Warehouse, Orders, Inventory) and guided
how I structured the program later on.

While the diagram includes some logic that wasnâ€™t coded initially,
it reflects the full business process as it would operate in a real
supply chain environment.
